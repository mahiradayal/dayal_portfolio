                        <p>Jessica Motatey works at a legal helpline for domestic violence victims in New York City. In early April, when COVID-19 cases were at a peak, she said she got a frantic call from a victim whose abuser took her children away from her — and refused to let her see them, talk to them or bring them back home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The victim was in a tough spot because she was still married to her abuser. Motatey explained that their divorce and child custody cases were on indefinite hold because courthouses were closed, and since there was no order to enforce, the police said they couldn’t intervene.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Her abuser threatened her, said he would assault her and report her to the Administration for Children’s Services and there was nothing she could do,” Motatey said. “They were amicable before the pandemic, and the minute something changed, he decided to keep the children.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>New York City’s domestic violence hotline has seen an increase in calls the last 6 months compared to calls last year, per data provided by Safe Horizon. The pandemic has forced families into close quarters — which experts say caused an increase in partner violence. At the same time, since thousands lost their jobs, abusers gained new control over victims who can’t escape because they aren’t financially independent. Even though domestic violence has increased during the pandemic, it’s harder for survivors to file petitions for orders of protection, resolve child custody cases and alleviate financial abuse through spousal and child support because court services are limited and inaccessible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Family courts moved all operations online in March, but since they shut their doors, there has been a huge dip in the number of petitions people have filed. Data provided by the court system shows that the number of domestic violence and custody visitation filings fell from 40,000 between May and August last year down to 7,600 this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to Shani Adess, the associate director of the domestic violence law unit at New York Legal Assistance Group, this drastic 80% fall is because physical locations are closed. Victims used to walk into a courthouse and immediately file a petition with a clerk, she said, but now they need to call a court or agency and fill out documents from their own homes. For people who live with their abusers or don’t have steady internet, this can be challenging. And many don’t even know who to call.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Some people didn’t know courtrooms closed and walked over. Unfortunately, the [instructions on how to access services remotely] on the buildings were only in English,” Adess said. “This means the wide swath of survivors who don’t speak English, or any survivor who wasn’t able to make it to the courthouse had no idea how to actually access services.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elizabeth Schneider, a professor who teaches a course on domestic violence law at Brooklyn Law School said the hardest thing for a woman, even before the pandemic, was to figure out how to get legal help — and now it’s even harder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“To be really locked in with an abuser is just the worst thing I can imagine. [Victims] used to at least be able to walk to a family court, but they can’t anymore,” she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Courts are the de-facto escape for many domestic violence victims. While shelters in New York City are considered an essential service and remained open throughout the pandemic, Myra Ricard, a program director at the Freedom House domestic violence shelter, said that many survivors don’t know shelters exist — and those who do often think they’re drug-infested, high crime and unsafe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The pandemic also overlaps with the Black Lives Matter movement — and an increased fear of police brutality against people of color, noted Adess. But for domestic violence victims who are in dire need for orders of protection and can’t access remote court services, a police report might be their quickest known alternative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So at the same time our civil courts were closing, survivors heard discussions about how safe it might or might not be to engage with police,” she said. “At this moment, a lot of doors were shut to them.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>But filing a petition is only the first step for many domestic violence cases, and it doesn’t guarantee a prompt court date, said Anna Maria Diamani, a director at Her Justice, which recruits and mentors attorneys to provide free legal advice to women living in poverty. There is a backlog in the family court system that spans over different stages: Some cases that existed before March still haven’t had court dates yet and some that were mid-trial or close to a resolution had to stop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We don’t know yet how big the backlog is, or will be, and don’t know how long victims should expect to wait,” she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Urban Resource Institute, which is the biggest domestic violence shelter in the country and in New York City, installed better WiFi in their shelters so clients could file petitions and attend virtual court hearings. Elizabeth Brownback, a director at URI said shelter residents are significantly better off than victims who don’t have access to the technology to support a video call, lack privacy or have their children in the vicinity. All of these factors can make it harder to present a case.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Domestic violence rulings rely heavily on credibility because incidents are often in isolation, lack witnesses and have no record.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“With domestic violence there isn’t a lot of evidence beyond comparing body language and tone with the words being said — and that can be challenging through video where there are lags and people naturally miss words,” Adess said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sherri Donovan, who has been a family lawyer in New York for over 30 years, said she recently saw a case where a victim had internet problems, so the judge told her to just call in instead. “If the abuser has video and the victim doesn’t, they’re at a huge disadvantage,” she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But it could actually be safer to distance victims from their abusers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Before the pandemic, when domestic violence victims would go to court, it was terrifying,” said Donovan. “Many times I would have to call a court officer over because the abuser was stalking or yelling at me and my clients — sometimes we had to take the back staircase.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“One of my clients had a virtual trial for a continued order of protection,” said Adess. “Not being a couple of feet away from the person who abused her definitely made her feel much safer.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is also easier to testify without an audience, studies indicate. Standing face-to-face with an abuser can trigger the brain’s defense circuitry and impair the prefrontal cortex, which controls rational brain function. This paralyzes a victim and stops them from engaging in decision making, complex cognitive behavior and expression. Existing in the same physical space as an abuser can also bring back past trauma, which can, according to experts, sometimes result in immobility and dissociation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“There is a plus to virtual courts,” said Donovan. “Crises like the pandemic hurt so many people, but if they can promote permanent positive change, like getting technology to people who need it and keeping survivors far from abusers, something good could come from a bad situation.”</p>
